kept on getting type error

t seems that you are trying to find the next birthday of a contact whose birthday is within 30 days from today. However, there is a TypeError in your code. The error message indicates that the first argument passed to the strptime() function should be a string, but it is a datetime.datetime object. The strptime() function is used to parse a string representing a date and time into a datetime.datetime object. To fix this error, you can convert the datetime.datetime object to a string using the strftime() function and then pass the resulting string to the strptime() function. Here is an example:

Python
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.

import datetime

# create a datetime.datetime object
dt = datetime.datetime.now()

# convert the datetime object to a string
dt_str = dt.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')

# parse the string back into a datetime.datetime object
dt_parsed = datetime.datetime.strptime(dt_str, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
In this example, we first create a datetime.datetime object using the now() method. We then convert this object to a string using the strftime() method and parse the resulting string back into a datetime.datetime object using the strptime() method. You can replace dt with your datetime.datetime object and '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S' with the format string that matches your date and time format.

Once you have fixed the TypeError, your code should work as expected. If you have any further questions or concerns, please let me know.
